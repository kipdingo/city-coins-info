As of December 9, 2021, NYC city coin (or "NYCC"):
* is _**not**_ available to buy on any exchanges (maybe Okcoin soon, but not yet)
* _**is**_ available to "buy" by doing a swap with someone who already has NYCC (which they would have gotten by mining it)

Steps to do a swap

1. find someone to swap with
    * join discord (https://chat.citycoins.co/)
    * visit the "nyccoin - nyc" channel, and:
        * ask if anyone is selling, or
        * scroll through the history to find someone who posted recently that they're selling
    * connect with whoever that person is via DM, agree on terms
        * Specifically, you'll need to agree on how much STX you're offering, and how many NYCC you get.
        * This will often be stated like "0.02 STX per NYCC".
        * For example, if you wanted to use 100 STX (~$220 USD at current price) and the rate was 0.02 STX per NYCC, you would get 5,000 NYC in return (100/0.02 = 5,000)
    * once you agree, you (as the "buyer") will set up a "swap" using Catamaranswaps

2. get ready for doing a swap
    * purchase STX from an exchange such as Okcoin or Kucoin
        * If you intend to swap 100 STX for 5,000 NYCC, you would need to get 100 STX first, and you would do this by purchasing STX from an exchange.
        Some exchanges sell STX, others do not. Use whatever exchange you like, as long as you end up with STX. Also, it's a good idea to include a few extra STX to use for fees, these will occur from time to time. 5 STX should be plenty.
    * create a supported wallet
        * This is required for doing CityCoins stuff. Currently, your choices of supported wallets are Hiro or Xverse, but since you want to do a _swap_, you'll need to use Hiro – it's the only wallet that supports both CityCoins as well as swaps.
        * For reference, here's the list of supported wallets: https://docs.citycoins.co/about-citycoins/how-do-i-get-started
    * transfer STX from earlier step (where you bought STX on an exchange)
        * you need to send your STX from that exchange to your Hiro wallet.

3. set up the swap
    * with STX in your Hiro wallet, you can proceed with setting up a swap
    * start here: https://docs.catamaranswaps.org/en/latest/
    * click on "STX - NYCC", should take you here: https://docs.catamaranswaps.org/en/latest/atomic.html#stx-nycc
    * click on the link under the "STX - NYCC" section, which should be here: https://www.catamaranswaps.org/stx-ft/SP2H8PY27SEZ03MWRKS5XABZYQN17ETGQS3527SA5.newyorkcitycoin-token::newyorkcitycoin
    * from here, you'll enter your amounts:
        * top box - "amount of tokens in smallest unit" - would be 5,000 (following same example numbers from earlier)
        * lower box - "amount of STX" – would be 100
        * middle part of the screen – should say "0.02 STX / FT" after you've entered the two numbers above; it figures out the rate and displays it to you
        * right input box – "Buyer" - this should be populated with your wallet address
        * left input box – "Seller" – you can leave this blank (no issues or risk), or you can ask the seller for their wallet address, and paste it there.
    * finish it off – click "Buy FT"
    
4. finish the swap
    * give the seller swap url you just created
    * they'll do the remaining steps on their end, and once the transactions are processed (within a few minutes), you should see 5,000 in your Hiro wallet
